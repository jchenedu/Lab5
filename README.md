**INCLUDED FILES ARE THE LOGS FOR TASK 1-3, SCRIPTS AND THE GIF I MADE**

Task 1:
Downloaded a sample csv dataset from the web; renamed the file to data and performed a random sampling of the file. Extracted the second column to another file. Then printed out the sorted column.

Task 2:
Created a script file to do Task 1.

Task 3:
Scraped a sample mp4 video from the web and renamed the file to video. Then used ffmpeg commands to convert the video into a gif.
